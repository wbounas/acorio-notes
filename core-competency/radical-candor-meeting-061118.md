# Core Competency Chat (Jen Miller)
## Radical Candor

Many people `mis-use` the term

_Radical Honesty:_ self-improvement type concept
- Bluntness in your personal life (to solve problems)

_Radical Transparency:_ radical approaches that open the transparency of the organization
- Bridgewater: Client who has a CEO that records _every conversation_
  - Ray Dalio - CEO

`Radical Candor:` Saying what you think, and giving a damn about the person you're saying it to

**Kim Scott - Radical Candor: Be a Kickass Boss without Losing Your Humanity**

_Radical Candor Quadrant:_ Care Personally....Challenge Directly

**Radical Candor** is `HIP`
`Helpful:` Humble, Helpful
`Immediate:` not something you stew on, in person, in private, or in public if
             it's _praise_
`Don't Personalize!!:` (you _sound_ stupid vs. you __are__ stupid)

Honest Feedback is the atomic building block of good management

When giving peer review for APEX, try to give _one actionable item_ for that
person to improve upon

The _best leaders_ want independent thought and debate
- Acorio wants you to have a `philosophy` and `opinion` about things that you can
  back up

**Organizational Musts for Radical Candor to Work:**
- Make back-stabbing impossible: don't let someone talk bad about another employee to you
  - You have the control to shut that down!
  - Don't be a back channel, you are not the person to fix the problem
  - Don't be the weekly dump session person
- If you are fighting with someone, after trying to talk to each other directly,
  maybe both of you should be going to your manager or HR together with the issue
  - Then the manager needs to be _fair_ and _fast_ and work through the issue
- Make it easier to speak truth to power
  - The senior folks in the company should be accessible to everyone in the company
  - Make it feel that the people who work for you speak truth
    - This is tricky, though, if you go above the head of your direct supervisor,
      this may seem like you are repeatedly going around your boss



**Direct Feedback is our Mantra**
- The types of relationships that can be achieved through these means are **massive**
