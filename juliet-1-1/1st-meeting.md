# First 1:1 with Juliet

The deal with 1:1's at this point
- 1:1's
- Mentor's
  - How all will go down
- How you're doing

Expectation: I come to the meeting with something that I need to ask for help on, clarification on,
	     bring something to the table
- Come prepared so it's a useful 1:1, and a useful use of everyone's time
  - Requires both me and Juliet to think

General 1:1's are a conversation, not a lecture or a powerpoint

At Acorio, we say managers meet once a week
- Sometimes it's twice a week, every two weeks
- Juliet starts 1/2 hour, once a week

HOWEVER, client meetings will make these meetings move
- 1:1's are the _easiest_ thing to schedule over


Mentor
John K. is a self-deprecating type of guy
  - Dale MC used to work with John K
    - it took 3 years to get John K over here

Reach out to john K. and say hey I know you're super busy, would you like me to check out
our collective calendars and put 2 30-minute blocks on there in perpetuity that we can always move?

ask D or Max if he is available to listen to another guided tour/mock kickoff
- I personally have the advantage of getting `both perspectives`
  - see if D can do a GT/Mock KickOff
  - see if Max can one as well
