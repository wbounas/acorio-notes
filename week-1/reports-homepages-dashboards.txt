Reports, Homepages, and Dashboards (Jesse Nocon)

What can we report on?
*Metrics*: A method of measuring something, or the results obtained from this
  - EX: "the report provides various metrics demonstrating stark sales performance this quarter"
  - Any existing field
  - One table at a time
- 167 Reports OOB already set up!
  - My reports: reports the user has created
  - Group: reports the user created, shared with the user, and shared with groups the user is a member of
  - Global: reports available to all users with the ITIL role
  - All: all of the above^ combined

Purpose of Reports: Helping people get their jobs done better
- Find out what someone's job is
- Find out the pain points of their job, what they have hard times with and try to make it easier

Good opportunity to flex creativity ASAP

NOTE: DO NOT WANT TO USE TABLES as Source TYPE
