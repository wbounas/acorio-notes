List Administration (Max Dore)
What is a List?
- Technically a report
- An informative

*In ServiceNow:*
Row === /Record/
Field === /Column/
Data is EVERYTHING
Data is stored in Tables
Lists are how we view Tables in ServiceNow

Changing the view of a table in your instance ONLY changes your PDI-view, not for everyone who will then view that table

List Filters
3 Ways:
1. Title Bar: At the top of the list (next to `Search [dropdown]`)
2. Filter Icon: Lets you choose any of the fields (columns) in the table
3. The Columns: Search insie each individual columns

The more you filter, the more your breadcrumb trail gets bigger

Wild Cards: extra characters added to your search values to help refine your queried search

*searchValue = contains the search value somewhere in the field

Global View = What everyone sees
Personalized List View = What you see with your specific changes to the list

Acorio Express Experts = Brianne, Chris, and David

Boost: feature that has been built by Acorio
- Extra add-on to the ServiceNow Platform
- Documentation provided by Acorio

KSC = search description Boost built by Acorio

What is a form? A form displays fields for a single record, and allows users to edit those fields or the content within them

If you have the "Number" of a form, enter it into the Global Search Field and you will find it instantly

In Form Layout:
Adding to another slush bucket...
/Green/ - References another Table
/Red/ - List 

UI Actions are either BUTTONS or RELATED LINKS
EX: Update, Resolve, Save, Delete

Update does not leave the page
Save will leave the page, taking you to the last page in the instance (regardless of the tab you were in)

NOTE: Right-clicking on the header opens up the /Context Menu/
