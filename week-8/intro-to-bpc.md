# Introduction to the BPC Role (Barbara Hare)

Reasons why Large Scale Projects Fail:

Not understanding business needs
- You will not be deploying a solution that will meet all business needs
- Might purchase a tool that's not exactly right, then you customize and it
  gets harder and harder


The way ServiceNow and Acorio approach that is that you get capture `solid requirements`
up front
- Every business likes to think they're special and different, but in reality the way
  they want to use `Incident` is going to be every similar to how other companies use it

If we were to do OOB deployment, most people would not be happy

The BPC is a member of the Project Leadership Team (PLT)

RAACI = Responsible Acountable, Consult, and Inform

All the tasks and activities on one side, the roles on the other side

The person who is accountable for the task gets an A for that task
- The person who is responsible for doing the task gets an R
- If someone has to be consulted during the task, they would get a C
- Anyone who has to be informed that the task is happening, gets an I

This way, people who are working on the project understand their role
and what they're responsible on a project

In a PLT structure, there is a 3-legged stool

EM, BPC, TA

The traditional 3-legged stool is people, process, tech
We have this utilizing Acorio-roles

EM is responsible for overall project budget, but the TA is responsible
for the technical aspects, and the BPC is refining business processes
and understanding them from the customer's perspective

The very beginning of the project is when the BPC is working hardest,
during workshops talking to the customer about:
- functionality within the tool
- bridge the gap on how they're doing things today, and how it will be
  optimized using SNOW

The BPC understands the requirements, they write the User Stories
- Review the User Stories with TA, EM, and the client
  - Client signs off and says this is a good representation of our
    requirements
  - Then, they can hand it off to the Architect to see how many hours
    it will take to build
- Helps delineate with the client what is considered in or out of scope


Looking at the sprints, and seeing if we are meeting our goals each time


BPC and/or BA will write release tests for others

They are also creating `Functional Process Guides`
- This is the guide for the customer to utilize different areas of the platform

CAT - customer tests the system, and report any found defects
- Many times, customers don't have the time or the ability to write test cases
  - We share with them OURS as a courtesy, and they can test against that
    - Sometimes, using that they get an idea of how to write their own release cases


Organizational Change Management Consulting
- Besides lack of requirements or lack of communication
- Lack of training or preparation

^^ Is a discipline of business that helps companies adjust and prepare for change
- Can be as simple as an `enhanced communication plan`
  - Who are the stake holders
  - Will they need training
  - How will that be provided
    - Will you need countdown clocks?
  - How visible will it be to which users?

Sometimes you see big banners everywhere about `Introducing Office 365` for example
- This is OCMC


Helping, coaching, guiding the customer around preparing and sharing that
communication with their Employees
