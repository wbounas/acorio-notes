# OSP Approach with Andrew Wortham

KICKOFF just like ETIU
- ServiceNow provides you a Slide Deck


KickOff is an Hour, deck does NOT take very long
- Majority of the kickoff is "Tell us about yourself"
  - Andrew skips that slide, comes back to it at the end
    - Instead, goes through the expectations first


Why did they buy the package they bought?
- Adventist bought 500 hours..... omygod

1 weekly touch point
- I will be the main contact, but will be pulling in people from the team at many different stages
  - I am in charge, but not the one solving everything

Give SN guys a heads up on the amount of hours
- I will probably have questions
  - Why was this sold? We have never used this many hours for an OSP client before

Make it VERY CLEAR about the hours and the limitation
- I have NO CONTROL or INFORMATION Nregarding that, but will talk to my supervisors and figure that out for you
- Any time spent working with them is considered billable time, we bill in increments of 30 minutes
  - We typically will end meetings 5 minutes early to recap

I will be starting a KickOff with a client that has 500 hours
- Slim chance I will be able to use all 500 hours myself
