# Weekly Knowledge Transfer (Andrew E., Jesse, D)

If you feel like you're starting to get overwhelmed with testing during
the week, _reach out to your EM_
- Communication is **critical** to your success as a tester

If you have time on Thursday or Friday
- If you have 10 hours projected for a project next week,
  _block if off_ (doesn't have to be permanent)
  - You can always move it if you need to (mark as tentative),
    or you can make sure to leave 2 hour chunks of time

**When in doubt, talk to Juliet**

**Common Things People want to know about in BP**
Service Portal
Reporting
Asset

Anything that `adds functionality` to the platform is _outside of the scope_
of the `ETIU` process
- If they are trying to improve or correct things that they did on their
  Express instance is _outside of the scope_

The only exception is something that would prevent **a successful upgrade**
