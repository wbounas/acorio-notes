# Express 2 Enterprise: Technical Validation (Aja D.)

**Technical Validation**
Always make sure you have open:
Product Operations Guide
- You're going to see Tech Validation steps here
  - `Validating the Development Instance`
  - There is a box article with check boxes
- Make sure that you're logged into HI
- Serch for `change` in the HI Service Portal
  - Go to `Open Changes`, and look for your specific client/company
- _Favorite_ this record, so you can easily get back to it

**Note on SLA's for Upgrades**
We want to have old _SLA's activated_ (active = true), and we want to have the
new SLA's actually `deactivated` until the client is ready to switch over
- Damien claims that there is _no impact_ if you are running both,
  but that is not what `acorio` was told to begin with
- Ensure that you give the client the documentation from the slide deck, so that
  they have all of this information

**If the client has had any issues getting into their instance:**
- They should know where to go for information on how to do this
- Sometimes you need to provide information on how to access the ticket in HI
