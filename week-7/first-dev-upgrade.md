`Creating the Master Change` - _very important_

Preferred Datacenter Region: Always `North America`

Go Line by Line and ENSURE that all the information is correct before
sending this through

**Set planned end date 2 weeks from today**
- Just sends you an email, doesn't really do anything
- More so for `metrics` on SNOW side

When crafting `Work Notes` for clients, ensure that you use the term
_Action Item_ when referring to things that they should be doing

Draft out your response in `Work Notes` so that you don't accidently
post an unfinished post to the client
- **NOTE:** You are sending `Additional Comments` to the client,
	    - `Work Notes` are for internal, SNOW use

**Example Communication with Client asking for `Remote.Services` Credentials:**
_Hi Evan, Ian,

Action item => Please forward the local remote.services user credentials today in order for us to perform our configuration validation needed prior to the kickoff.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Max Dore
