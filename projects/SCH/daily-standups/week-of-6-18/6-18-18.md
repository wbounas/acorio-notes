First day of build phase


Once the TC changes the state to `Ready for Testing` and
re-assigns to the _Tester_, the `Tester` performs
testing (follows test steps, negative test cases, smoke testing)
- If the story passes, the `Tester` will detail why the story passed
  in the work notes and assign it to the client


Make a note of which TC gave me the story, and ensure that you
are re-assigning it to the TC who gave it to me


Will reference stories in development, but do testing


Need to ask Max about story changes during our GT practice later today
