# Team Meeting September 26th, 2018

Update your skills matrix!
- This will enable us to put you on a project that you'll be able to be fully leveraged on
  - Hopefully giving you multiple things to do, giving you more hours and you're on
    less projects at once

Using Acorio Adminstration to bill unbillable time
- Document will be coming out
- Acorio will start to become more strict about this over time

## Omari's Demo
## Dealing with Ridiculous Requirements

_Get in Early!_
- Try to get involved as soon as possible with story creation
- Not every project allows it, but might
  - Try to work with TA or BA?
  - Try to be involved with the technical requirements

_Is the Story in your Wheelhouse?_
- Is it a Portal Story, but you're not the "Portal Expert"
  - Moving from app to app can make it very difficult
  - EX: Moving from Service Catalog to something else after a few months might be tough
    to remember how stuff works exactly

_Learn to say "No" or at least express your concern_
- Don't want to have to bring it up to the client later on if you get in over your head

_Resist Heavy Customization_
- Don't try to work around ServiceNow's **OBVIOUS** limitations
- Usually the BPC is the one that lets customizations slip in
  - People are eager to try and make their bosses happy
    - Just so happens the people typically agreeing to this are the ones who DON'T understand
      how ServiceNow works

--------------------------------------------

Catch your teammates "red-handed"
- Keep an eye out for teammates and make sure that you are supporting them correctly!
