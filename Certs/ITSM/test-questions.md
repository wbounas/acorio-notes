 ·     When in the Incident process is an Incident most likely to have its priority escalated? Initial diagnosis?
•
 ·     True or False, you’re only allowed to have one Knowledge Base in ServiceNow FALSE
 ·     Have some understanding of State Model constants and how to reference them in script
 ·     Familiarize yourself with Catalog Data lookup rules
 ·     Know OOTB roles, and what they can do.  Examples -- What role is required to close a problem? ITIL

·     Incident Management –
o  What is used to calculate business duration of an incident?
•	Opened and Resolved fields
o  Feature to determine first call resolution
•	Re assignment count if 0.
o  When can an end user close an incident?
•	 When state is resolved AND if it’s their own incident
o  Know the purpose/reasoning behind state vs. incident_state fields
•	Functionally, they are both the same because a business rule keeps them in sync. Historically, one was created before the other (I don’t recall which came first.) Some customers like to use incident_state independent of (task) state and some like to keep all the state fields together across all the task related tables (incident, problem, change_request, etc.)
•
•	Technically, state is inherited from task. incident_state is specific to the incident table. -Chuck Tomasi
o  Know what happens when an Incident gets associated with a problem (what state does the incident go to)
•	Incident state is On Hold + Awaiting Problem, Closed/Resolved of Problem sets Incident state to Resolved
o  Know how Incidents sync up when there are parent/child incident connections (what happens to the children incidents when a parent incident state changes, etc.)
•	Parent incident state changes to resolved, child incident state also changes to resolved
o  How long does it take for the incident to auto close after being resolved?
•	OOB 7 days
•	From Doc Site: When an incident state is set to a Resolved, an email notification is sent to the caller. If the caller is satisfied with the resolution, no action is required on behalf of the caller. The platform automatically closes the incident after 24 hours (K.N.)
o  What is the function to create incident via chat?
•	Support Connect
o  In Incident Management to impose limit for moving from one state to another where should the new logic be added?
•	Script include; incorporate new logic in the IncidentState script include
o  In baseline Incident, what field checks the first time to resolve for an incident?
•	Re assignment count; this is based on the reassignment count on the incident table and is triggered on the business rule(reassignment counter) that is on the task table
