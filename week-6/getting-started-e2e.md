# Getting Started E2E (Aja)

With this first 'Round' (have to play this one by ear..)
- Some of our student tasks in Academy will be impossible until we get HI accounts
- what our responsibilities are and what our partner's responsiblities are listed

**First Round**
- Ensure that tickets are properly updated
  - We don't currently have access, so we are going through our partners through
    communicating
  - Even if it's swapping a name out, or making a `Calenderly` link, it's getting
    the process in our head and getting it in our hands
- Perform `Techincal Validation` with the support of our _Partner_
  - You do _not_ need a ServiceNow account to do
  - Done 'behind-the-scenes' w/o the client present
  - As you're doing this, it's to take on more responsibilities, asking the right questions
    so that during the _next round_ you can do this all yourself
- Lead the **Kickoff** portion of the Kickoff/Guided Tour call with support and feedback
  from your partner
- Bookmarking `documentation` is critical
  - Don't have something shown to you more than a few times

**By the second round, we plan on having _you_ bill on the `Technical Validation`**
  - If you can totally do the work 95%+ _independently_, that is when it becomes
    `billable` time
- You will lead the entire `Kickoff/Guided Tour` with support and feedback from E2E
  Consultant
- Leading the entire `Best Practice` call with support and feedback from Partner
- Receive feedback and obtain resources/materials and enable improvement
**NOTE:** If your partner is _not_ stepping in to help or correct, this is when we start
	  thinking that your work is valid `billable time`

**Dates (May Change due to Timing with Accounts)**
First Round: This week + Next Week
Second Round: Following Two Weeks


**E2E Condensed Process Overview**

_There are 2 versions_
- Condensed (new)
- Long Process (old)
  - May fall back on the long process
  - _Specific situations_: before you even meet with client, and they are asking you a
    TON of questions (essentially get in a call before kickoff talking about kickoff)
    - This is an `indicator` to fall back on the _Long Process_
- _Another Indicator for Long_: if the client mentions **Change Approval Board**
  - If necessary, they wil open an incident and reference `Problems`
  - Another indicator that we could utilize the `Long Process`

### Process Overview
**We go into HI, and we change the state of the first ticket (ETIU01) to `Open`**
- We reach out at least once every other day for 1 week
  - Gotta call the client at least once
  - Can find the client's phone number in HI
  - If after 1 week you have _not_ received a response, change the state of the ticket
    back to `New` and add a work-note that you've been reaching out for a week, that you've
    called at this time, and left a message
    - "If it's not in HI, it didn't happen!"
    - "I offered to do this, the client said no"
    - Almost like a Police Record

With `Calendly`, a meeting will be autoamtically scheduled on the person who you're
working with's `calendly`

If possible, go with `Calendly`
- _Control the times_ that clients are able to schedule tickets

**Check the release and patch of the ticket**
- Most clients are on the proper one (Jakarta Patch 7 or 8)
- If a client is _not_ on one of those, they will need to upgrade before we continue in the
  process
  - Do not even _talk_ about the rest of the process until they perform that upgrade
