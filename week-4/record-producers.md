# Record Producers (John Nolan)

It will NOT be clear to the end-user if they are creating a _request_ or an _incident_

What a Record Producer does is create records on tables extending from TASK (Incident, Problem, Change)

**Used to create the "one-stop-sop" expereince for the end-user on ServiceNow**
- Should be used for:
  - Reqeusts that fall outside the scope of what an ITIL Service Catalog would typically offer
  - Items that would fall outside the scope of Request, Reqeuest Item, and Catalog Task
