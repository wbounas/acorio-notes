# Certifications (Mike Hanrahan)
- A way for ServiceNow to verify that you are credible in the domain that you are working in

*NEW DEVELOPMENT*
- This is new in the ServiceNow eco-system
- Customers will be asked to see that everyone is

As the platform grows, _SNOW_ is creating new certifications in new areas..

Certified System Administrator (CSA) or ServiceNow Fundamentals are the *SAME THING*
/_2 Parts_/
- Fundamentals
- Technical

Multiple choice style questions
- Can mostly rule out at least 1 of the questions
  - If you CAN'T, maybe skip and come back

*Order of Certifications to Obtain*
1. CSA (Certified System Administrator)
2. ITIL (let Mike H. know when you're at this point)
3. ITSM (IT Service Managements)
4. Certified Application Developer (CAD)
  - Building apps on the platform
  - What ServiceNow was originally built on

//-- Then you start learning a particular applications --//

*ITOM*
- Very big platform, you could spend an entire career w/o learning all of ITOM 
  - Rumors of `micro-certifications` 

ServiceNow will require `Re-Certifications`
- This is a *new policy*
- You have to take `X` amounts of classes and credits to stay current with your certification

*Mike H.'s Advice*: "Play around in your PDI! The book knowledge is not necessarily the same knowledge you need in order to be a great Acorio Consultant!"

*In Acorio.NOW*: _IGNORE_ anything that says `Accreditation`
