- Something that _none_ of our competitors do is provide a set of `core-competencies`

_The ability to move fluidly and quickly between different areas of work without losing overview or focs_

- Modern advances and workplaces have made multitasking unavoidable and necessary- Be able to deal with ad hoc situations
- Context swtitching between projects/clients = requiring you to prioritize tasks around deadliens and in order of importance

*The Benefit*:
- This means an employee will work on a wide variety of tasks during the course of a nomral work week

*Top Tips for Mutlitasking*
- Plan your work (if you fail to plan, you plan to fail)
- Use calendar to time block and commit to sticking to it as best you can
  - Stay true to what's on your calendar!
- Do not jump to react to emails and IMs
- Prioritization!!! Proactive work vs. reactive work
- Set deadlines, ask others for deadlines when given work
  - Do not drop `everything` for someone at any given moment!
- Use tools: `Trello`, `Pomodoro Method`, time blocking, etc.
