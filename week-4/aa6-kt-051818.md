**Glide Aggregate vs Glide Record**
- ServiceNow says use Glide Aggregate for performance reasons
- _getRowCount()_ has a lot of bugs, never use this (from SNOW)

`[sys_user_grmember]` --> table where to query for members of a group


Tip: when in doubt, try something that is pre-existing and see if it works!
- See if you can build on it, or replicate the functionality

**System Properties** (Use them, they help everybody!)
- In dev instances, you do _not_ want all emails to send out to users
  - However, in production you do!
- The value of your `sys_properties` need to be changed **before** exporting your update set
  - If the names do not match properly, you will not be importing the correct data in `Prod`!

**Web Services** (pass data back and forth in different ways)
- Soap Message (XML), other ways (REST)
  - Inbound to SNOW
  - Outbound to 3rd party system

**Take a step back, and think about the big picture**
- Where is the data coming from?
- What are the triggers that are making data move (in either direction)

**A nice thing about ServiceNow**
- There are a lot of UI Actions to generate example code, or actions
  - EX: load in external URL of IdP, and all of a sudden data gets populated automatically
- SNOW parses a lot of data for you when working with some 3rd-party services

**`This` is self-referential**
- It is referncing an object that is going to be created (instantiation of the class, 
  using the `new` keyword)
- The context is whatever `this` refers to

**All objects in JavaScript extend from Object object**
- If you use a constructor function, that new object will have a prototype of Object
- If you use Object.create method to create a new instance of an object, the new prototype of 
  that new instance will be an `intermediary` between the Object

### Do not conflate the objects of the DOM with Prototypical Inheritance

Another name for `scope` is _Dreamspace_
- The `Global Dreamspace`

**Acorio.NOW connects Sales with Pre-Sales using Catalog Items**
- When Sales is at the point with a client where they want to show something to the client,
  they use PreSales Requests (which are RITMS)
  - This is a unique way to use ServiceNow, that our clients don't necessarily apply
