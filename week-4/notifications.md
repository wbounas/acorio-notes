# Notifications (David Sok)

`${URL_REF}` = This allows you to input a URL based on the current record using string interpolation

Approvals happen on the approval table, outside of the scope of a change request

Mail Script = Template that you can call throughout the platform

`[sys_email.LIST]` = Best friend when creating or testing notifications
- You can verify if emails have sent with all the information you need 

### Event Driven Notifications
- You want this when a specific event takes place
- More complex criteria
- One-offs

For the most part, creating basic notifications will be done using the GUI's condition-creator
