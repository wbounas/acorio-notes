# All About EM's (John Bolton)

The place is where most EM's spend their time is on the _templates_
- Very process oriented
- They follow the methodology
  - Many templates involved in the execution of a project

Typically, the first thing done when starting a project is pulling down the **EM Workbook**
- The **EM Workbook** is always used when starting a new project

The EM is the one, consistent resource that participates in _every_ step of the AAIM process
- During the initiate phase, there is a contract signed and an EM and PTO are assigned
  - They participate in the Sales-to-Delivery meeting
  - From there on, they _own the project_
    - Adherence to the SOW (contract) ("the essance of what an EM does")
    - Typically, all SOW are stored on `Box` (/Client/Pre-Sales/Contracts/SOWs)
    
**Scope**: where the rubber starts to meet the road
- Tells us what our deliverables are
  - Actions that Acorio needs to provide for the project
  - We are responsible for managing all of this activity, and adhering to the contract

We have to align with the client, but also have to align internally
- If we have talented people, 60% will be removing hurdles
  - The other 40% will be dedicated to the customer
- At the end of the day, we help the customer meet their business objectives @ the 
  same time executing the SOW
  - Acorians _must_ understand what is in the SOW so we don't do more or less than what's expected

## Scoping Sheet
**Fixed-Fee SOW**: agreeing on the price beforehand, so regardless of the materials or time that is extra, Acorio has to eat that cost
  - Acorio takes the risk
_-versus-_
**Times & Material SOW**: there is an estimate of time and cost, but it could extend past that
  - Customer takes the risk

The work needs to be proportionate for the amount of hours that are provisioned
- EX: There are many ways that you could write a document
  - The hours are a way to give you a roadmap on how to manage your time correctly
- Tells Acorians how `shallow` or `how deep` you can go on a project

#### First thing you should ask an EM when starting a new project
- "What is the output of what I am doing?"
  - If you are being told to handle a story, the output would be:
    "What is the acceptance criteria?"
    - You need to code something that fits the story and acceptance criteria (this is your output)
- "How much time do I have budgeted to do this work?"
- "When is it due?"

It is the EM's job to manage the AAIM process
- It is YOUR job to understand your role in the process, and understand how much time you have
  - If you have any questions, ask Architect, BPC, or EM to get your question answered

**Project Leadership Team** (PLT)
- Team consisting of BPC, EM, and Architect
- At the end of the day, it's the EM that is following the project end to end
  - BPC drops off at the end of the define phase
  - The Architect usually drops off at the end (or has less involvment) at the end of the build phase
  - The BPC phase comes back in during transition, and can help during training
  - Sometimes people are coming in and out

#### EM Checklist
- Checklist of everything (not `everything`) that the EM is supposed to do during an engagement
  - Broken down by phase
- Like when a doctor goes into surgery, there are some basic things you must do
  - You don't always do everything, but you have to check to see if you need to do them
  - It's a good idea to go through the checklist to see if `this is an activity I should be doing`

**Documents that puts Rails around a project**
1. SOW puts in words what the scope of the project is
  - What the objectives are
  - Go through, and basically put project assumptions in, how many resources they need, what we
    will be doing, what the deliverables are, what the scope of the process are
2. The Scoping Sheet gives you the numbers
  - Takes everything in words and puts them into hours
  - Then it's the EM's job to take the hours, and put them into `Projector` so everyone knows
    how much time they've been allocated each week

**EM takes the SOW, and they create a `Project Plan`**
- Project Plans have the same `Phases` as the AAIM
  - SOW translated into a Schedule

Then take the Scoping Sheet, and that goes into `Projector`
- Following the plan, we need to manage our resources and hours using `Projector`

**What an EM does**
- An EM supports the entire Project Lifecycle
  - This is _really critical_
  - All the way from `initiate` to `close`
- Really important everyone on the _PLT_ are on the same page
  - Take SOW, translate into Project Schedule that is shared ongoingly
- Once there is a plan, and hours are in Projector, need to keep an eye on `Scope`

While Acorio does their best to figure out what the customer needs, sometimes the customer 
doesn't know for themselves
- As we uncover things in the contract, things will be added to the scope (not in SOW), 
  or things could be _removed_ from scope
- When we find things are being added or removed from Scope, we need to have a `Change Order`
  - Tells you the area impacted
  - What we are adding or removing
- This is the EM's job to manage, making sure that the work being performed is on the SOW
  - If we are providing something additional (not on the SOW), we utilize a Change Order (CO)

We monitor our work by:
- Weekly Status Calls
  - Bringing team together, reminding where we are in process/schedule
  - EM sends weekly status report to customer
    - EM's job to continuously align the client with Acorio
    - Takes a lot of time, use a lot of tools to get that done
- Spend 60% internally, and 40% on customer to ensure they are ready to _accept_ the solution

##### Intangible of _Leadership_
- Leadership skills are probably the most important skills (outside of putting together a plan)
- **Communication** is key
  - The team should know _at all times_ where we are in the process, what the priorities are,
    what the primary hurdles are
  - These are all _critical_ to the team staying on the same page

"This is where we're going, any questions?"
vs
"This is where we're going, does anyone see any inhibitors to that process?"

##### **Try to understand what your EM's style is**
- Just like they have to understand our styles
- Adapt the way you provide information dependent on the style of the people you work with
  - The frequency
  - The detail
  - Need to continuously assess
- One of the _outcomes of success_ when you're starting out your career
  - Do your first project, you're successful
  - NO project is the same twice
  - You are successful because:
    - You paid attention to details
    - You paid attention to the environment
  - _DO NOT_ assume that because you were successful with one project, you will be with another
    - It is simply **not true!!!**
- Go into a new project with *eyes wide open*
  - You must validate every project like the first time you were on a project!

**Fit for Purpose**
Someone had an idea of how much time it would take
- You need to understand this original way of thinking
  - This is so you are thinking the same way the original person planned it
    - If you have a question, you need to **ask** your EM or Architect so you are working together!
