# Things to Keep Note Of

## Things to improve in the future
- Bring Docs links for material pertaining to the lesson
  - Only for the first week or two, and maybe only 1 or 2 docs that are 
    "supplimental material" or "extended learning"
- When using the projector / screen on TV, make sure that the text is at a readable size
- Try not to break up a session right before lunch. Especially if exercises or labs are 
  the last thing you do before lunch
  - There should be a clear break point in the lesson before lunch so we know where 
    we are leaving off
- `Actionable Objectives` where each lesson, students are tasked to actively achieve an objective
  applying the knowledge just gained
