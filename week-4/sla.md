# SLA's (Delonte Bess)

## Service Level Agreements
A service-level agreement is an agreement between two or more parties, where one is 
the customer and the others are service providers
- No legal binding, a "handshake"

**A record in the SLA table which defines a set amount of time for a task to reach a certain condition**
- If the task does not rech the condition by a set amount of time, it is marked _`Breached`_
- EX: time constraint in the IT department for how long it takes to resolve a ticket

*Operational Level Agreement* (OLA): How departments work together to meet the service level agreement
- Again, `informal` "handshake"
  - These are internal agreements on how departments work together to hit the SLA


*Underpinning Contract (Legal, Formal)* - Defines and monitors the guarantees established 
with an outside provider
