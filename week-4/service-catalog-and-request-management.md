# Service Catalog and Request Management (John Nolan)

## Service Catalog:
A selection of selection of services and items available to order through a single serf-service interface
- Provides a standardized approach to request fufillment

A centralized place to request goods or service

- You have the ability to create multiple catalogs

### Request Management Basic Structure (one item)
Request --> Request Item (Sales Laptop) --> Approval (Sales Group) --> Task 1 (get laptop out of storage) --> Task 2 (put software on laptop) --> Task 3 (give laptop to requestor)

Catalog Tasks are _specific_ to the catalog item they are associated with

If a request has multiple request items, the request is not considered *Closed Complete*

**Glossary**
_Request_: Records that are generated to help keep track of an order (REQ00100001)
_Requested Item_: within a request generated by a catalog order, each item ordered is given 
		a specific record to track that item (RITM0010002 and RITM00100003)
_Service Catalog_: One stop shop for goods and services
_Catalog Tasks_: Tasks that need to be completed in order to fufill the request from the Service Catalog
_Catalog Items_: The "building blocks" of the Service Catalog, providing an easy experience for 
	       requesting items from a Service Provider, whether IT or otherwise
_Fields_: Area for data to be populated in a record on the table (whether you're 
	  looking at the list or form view)
_Variables_: These are the "questions" that are prompting user input on a Catalog Item or Record Producer to request a good, service, or otherwise

*Basic ITIL Roles*
1. End Users (requesting things)
2. Fufillers (getting things)
3. Admins (configuring things) 

Assignment Groups are done at the Catalog Task level, instead of the Request or Requested Item
- Catalog Tasks can only be assigned to one Assignment Group at a time
- This is why you would create multiple tasks for each group
  - Sometimes 1 Assignment Group can have multitple tasks, and that is a conversation for the 
    client to determine how to break up Catalog Tasks

**Catalog Items:**
- Not a lot of functionality on mobile at this time
  - Documentation is available @ docs.servicenow.com

- Each Catalog Item should *ALWAYS* have a workflow associated with it

Once the framework for the Catalog Item has been established, rather than click "Submit", 
  open the context menu and hit "Save"

**Variables:**
- Associated with a Catalog Item
- Questions that are asked when requesting a Catalog Item
- You can have variables on a Catalog Item that are _not_ mandatory
NOTE: NOT FIELDS, rather they store data for a particular requested Catalog Item
