# ServiceNow System Administration Participant Guide
## Module 1: ServiceNow User Interface
### Section 1.1: UI Essentials

**Module 1 Objectives**
- Examine the User Interface (UI)
- Personalize, Customize, and brand your Instance
- Work with Lists and Forms
- Explore Filters, Breadcrumbs, and Search Functionality

The User Interface (UI) is the main way to interact with the applications and information
in a ServiceNow instance, so we begin the System Administrator course with an exploration
of the features and capabilities of the ServiceNow Interface

"ServiceNow is changing the way people work." - Fred Luddy
- "When I started ServiceNow, my vision was to build a cloud-based platform that would
  enable regular people to create meaningful applications to route work through an enterprise."

**ServiceNow is an Enterprise Software as a Service (SaaS) platform.**
- In order to successfully complete this System Administration training, you will
  need access to a ServiceNow instance, and System Administrator credentials.
- Users only see applications they are authorized to use
- The System Administrator role can be used to develop appications and can see all
  Applications and Modules

**User Interface: Key Platform Components**
The User Interface (UI) is the main way to interact with the applications and information
in a ServiceNow instance
- Notable ServiceNow features include:
  - Real-time form updates
  - User Presence
  - Redesigned Application Navigator with tabs for favorites and history
  - Enhanced Activity Streams

## The ServiceNow user interface is divided into three areas:
1. **Banner Frame**
  - The `Banner Frame` highlights important tools and settings that apply to your instance
2. **Application Navigator**
  - The components of the Application Navigator, the panel on the left side, are based
    upon your assigned role(s)
  - The Navigator may be Expanded (as shown above) or Collapsed
  - The Navigator provides links to all Application Menus and Modules
3. **Content Frame**
  - The `Content Frame` displays information, such as:
    - Lists
    - Forms
    - Homepages
    - Knowledge Bases
    - Service Catalogs
    - Wizards, such as `Catalo Ordering`, `Create Incident`, and `Knowledge Tree`

### User Interface: Banner Frame
The **`Banner Frame`** runs across the top of every page and contains global navigation
controls, and several key functionalities and features:
- Your logo in the `top left hand corner`, which also navigates you back to your
  Homepage when you click on it
- Information about logged-in User. Click the down arrow to the right of the User Name
  to view the User Profile or log out
  - **NOTE:** With `additional rights`, the user may see _Impersonate User_ and _Elevate Roles_
	      as additional options
- Click the `Magnifying Glass` to expand the `Global Search Toolbar`.
  - Use this to _search across all data_ in `ServiceNow`, such as `keywords`, `record numbers`,
    and more
- Toggle on and off the **Connect Sidebar**, which is used to communicate with other
  users in real-time
- Get help, including `Product Documentation` and new features
- Personalize your `System Settings`

### User Interface: Application Navigator
Default: Expanded (Maximized) View
`Applications` are a collection of `Modules` for a specific process like `Incident` or `Change`
The **Application Manager** is a list of available `Applications` and their corrresponding
`Modules`
- `Applications` contain one or more `Modules`, which group together related information and
  functionality
- `Modules` contain:
  - Links to a new record
  - Lists of records with varyfing filters applied
  - Special visual tools

To view all `Applications` within the Navigator, ensure that the **All Applications** icon
is selected at the top left of the Navigator
**TIP:** Double-click the `All Applications` icon to expand and/or collapse `All Applications`

### User Interface: Filter Navigator
To quickly search through your `Application Navigator` to view a particular `Application` or Module,
use the **Filter Navigator**
- The `Filter Navigator` is located at the top of the `Application Navigator`

As soon as you begin typing, the Applicatio Navigaator displays on Applications and/or Modules
matching your keyword
-EX: If you type Incident" into the Filter Navigator, you are viewing a list of the Incident
     Application and _all_ its Modules, as well as te any Modules containing the word "Incident"
     within other Aplications, such as **Service Desk > Incidents**

The Appication Navigator, sometimes called the `Left Navigation Bar`, provides access to all
applications and the modules they contain, enabling users to quickly find information and services

An application is a group of modules, or pages, that provide related information and functionality
in aninstance.
  - For example, the Incident appication contains modules for creating and viewing incidents
  - The Configuration Management application contains modules for configuring servers, databases,
    and networks

In UI16, the Application Navigator also provides access to Favorites (bookmarks), and History
(recently viewed items)

### User Interface: Favorites and History
Favorites:
- Access the Favorites menu to see all your favorites in one place
**NOTE:** In `UI16`, Bookmarks and Favorites are the same thing
Your HIstory:
- The Navigator contains a scrolling list of yoru recent history within ServiceNow
For Example: the forms you were filling out, lists you were seraching on, homepages you were
	     viewing: all these are visible within the `Your History` tab
- Simply click on an item to open any recent activity in your Content frame

### User Interface: Mobile Access
**Smartphone:** The smartphone interface supports many of the features found in the standard
desktop/laptop browser interface, including:
  - Lists
  - Forms
  - Filtering
- There are no special configurations needed for the iPhone or Android phones; the smartphone
  interface uses a familiar industry-standard techniques for performing most actions
