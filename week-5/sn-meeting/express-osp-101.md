# Express & OSP 101 (Ricky + Stephen from ServiceNow)

What you will learn
- How to speak with confidence about Express
- How to be an Outsourced Strategic Partner (OSP)
- How to adopt Remote Services

Express Background
Express is _fast_ for customers
- Fast solution
  - Can deploy in a couple weeks
  - Does not require in-depth configuration
  - Simple: no scripting knowledge required
- Guides you through the process

Sometimes, when you get into the weeds of the application, you open a can of worms
  - Sometimes, less is more

Features Originally Deveoped for Express
- System Admin Dashboard
  - One central location to find their toolkits
- Guided Setup
- Codeless Business Rules
  - Repeatable
  - Simple (no coding required)
- MID Server Installation Wizard

Sometimes, these features are tailored to _Express_, not the ServiceNow Platform

- Customers need to _upgrade_ to gain access to their plugins
- HR
- Performance Analytics
- Etc..

Try to feel out where the client is in their ServiceNow Journey
- This will help determine how deep you want to go into any particular topic

**New ITSM Features and Options Not Available in Express**
- Workflow Engine
- SLA Timelines
  - _Big One_ for customers, they are constrained in Express
    - Can't do schedules
- Full ServiceNow Store
- Service Portal



## How to be an OSP
For remote services, SN has our back
- If we start to miss deadlines, then they start to question the process

**When you are assigned a request, you have 2 days to respond to that request**
- The only way to respond is through the HI Portal (at this time)
  - There, you will have a dashboard with all of your application

_Remote Admin_: Bucket of hours
- You can leverage these hours within the scope of Remote Admin
  - Outside of the scope is ITOM
- You can do PA, HR, almost any other area of the platform
  - Because of this, the level of uncertainty and confusion can come in
  - As a consultant, you might have trouble `scoping the request`


#### Make Customers Insanely Happy
All about the CSAT

**OSP Library**
- Documentation for how to do many different things (high frequency requests)
  - How to submit a request, etc.

If a customer has a backlog of requests, and has more hours available, see if you can
leverage that to create a request on the customer's behalf

- Take advantage of the escalation button
  - There is always something to learn from an escalation

**Journal fields are _NOT_ reportable**
- Customers will _not_ be able to articulate where they want to pull data from when
  creating a report
  - Journal fields unfortunately are not available
  - *Workaround*: You can use the `Metrics Table` to utilize some of that

A lot of our requests have to do with the `State` Field
- Do not change the `State` of a request if you have not completed an `Action`

Stay off the Naughty List! (Do not build a back-log)
- It will be hard to get out of that back-log

### Key Takeaways
- When you are delivering Remote Services, you are ServiceNow
  - From the customer's perspective, you are SN
  - Depending on the account...
- Drive the Project
  - Over-project requests
    - More hours than you think are necessary
  - Underbill (makes the customer feel good)
    - Helps CSAT score
- Slack is your friend
- Stay off the naughty list
- Great CSAT scores
- Have fun!

**Enter your time when you're working on the ticket** (Be Courteous to Ricky and Steven)
- When you do the work, update the notes
  - _Bill your time_
- This will reduce time-zone issues
- If you wait until the 31st to go back and back-date your entries, then you will run into problems

**IF YOU _FORGET_ to bill your time:**
- You will have to wait for Stephen to re-open
  - Have to put notes down somewhere else
  - Might be a different month, other issues with P.O.'s
