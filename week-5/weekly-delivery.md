# Marci Meeting (Weekly Delivery)
## SLA's
SLA Measurement Standpoint = Extremely hard to gauge, different for every single company
Extremely Common SLA's
- Response Time
- Close Time

## Starting Data Helps
- Need to measure, see how things are working
  - EX: After two months of a single SLA implementation, maybe make it a little more aggressive
- Depends on the size of help desk, the industry the company is in (technology versus cakes)

"What _business problem_ are you trying to solve with these SLA's?"

SLA's used to mostly measure _time_ metrics
- How long it takes to complete a particular task


### Role-Playing

#### **Tips and Tricks**
- Look up people on LinkedIn to get the skinny on who you're meeting with
**Exectuive Sponsor**: Could mean _anything_

Preparing for a Conversation with a Client

Check out a client's history
- Previous HI tikets
- Digging into their Instance to see how they currently do it
- Leverage the experience of fellow Acorians

#### Client Demo's
- Plan out your actions
  - Not necessary word for word _scripting_
  - Find the particular `Asset Record` that you _know_ will work
- Find out from your point of contact what's relevant, what's important to them
  - This will make the client feel more personalized and tailored

5 Why's (Keep repeating `Why?`)
- Eventually, you _will_ get to the business problem

Most clients asks for the Solution, sometimes even they provide it!
- Doesn't not necessarily mean that it's bad

"Can we talk more about the business problem that we are trying to solve? If I better
understand the business problem, that will help me in establishing a solution
that will work for the long term!"

Don't jump too quickly into the Technical Solution
- Ask the 5 Why's...
- Give a slight pause when a customer presents _you_ with a solution
