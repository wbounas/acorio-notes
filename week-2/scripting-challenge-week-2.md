# Weekly Scripting Challenge

Script Include = Re-Usable Code
- EX: One function that you'll use over and over again?
  - When you write Business Rules, you can utilize that script include and use it in a bunch of Business Rules without having to re-write it again

Naming Convention: start Script Includes with a Capital Letter
EX: MyScriptInclude
