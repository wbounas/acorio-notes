# 1:1 with John Kanthak Halloween 2018

Commonly listening for .update() on a table (by default)
- Workflow
- Business Rules (when 'update' is checked)
- Notifications


`Workaround to not trigger above when successfully update:`
.setWorkflow(false) <- interecepts the .update() event from hitting the above 3 features

### `Question:` Does calling insert or update use that up, and then it defaults back to true? ("consumable")
### `Question:` Audit history is 99% accurate, but .setWorkflow(false) does NOT write to the audit-history


`Pulling Values from List Collector (Sluch Bucket)`
- Intricate, have to pull out sys_id's (can be a pain)


Asset is a specific instance of a HW or SW item
- EX: Monica's instance of Office 365 on her Thinkpad

Capex: Capital Expense vs Opex: Operating Expense
- Hospital opening a new clinic
  - Expanding the CAPITAL of the company
  - After they cut the red ribbon, and we do something else, it is a OPEX (Operating Expense)


Anytime you're working with a List Collector, you typically want to _SPLIT_ the values into an Array for easy iteration
- if there are multiple values, it is a `"superduperlongstring,thatisseparated,bycommas"`
