**Scheduled Jobs**
Block of Code that executes on a regular, scheduled basis
- There's also System Scheduler > Scheduled Jobs
  - Those are pre-defined ones that are lined up to execute

`Inteceptors`:asking you what kind of change request you want/scheduled job (list of hyperlinks view)
- Doesn't really mean anything to clients, they don't need to learn it
  - Why don't we just call it a `menu`


Scheduled Job to run Once
- Could be like a "saved" background script
  - Background scripts are not persisted in the system

sysapproval_approver = the actual approval record
- this is NOT a person who is doing the approver

**Homework:**
what is the difference between using `.orderBy();` when querying, versus not
- what does it doe?

`.eventQueue` = method for firing notifications in JavaScript



**Use sys_properties to make your code more client maintainable!**
- Make a page, puts them all on one page!
  - Put it in the filter navigator!!!

**Homework** (use snapshot from 9am Friday 6/15)
how would we modify his code so that we could pass in a list
goal for his code
we need to fire one event for each person who has one or more delinquit (open) approvals
- need an email at 7am saying "you have 5 approvals waiting"
  - here is a chart saying what they are, and where they are
- we are currently achieving that by sending an email to each person,
  but we want to pass into the event an array
  - `.eventQueue` what types of parameters do you accept?

**Homework**
Familiarize myself with ArrayUtil(), and talk through each method
