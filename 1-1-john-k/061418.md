# 2nd Meeting with John K (Mentor)

Choice or Select Field
- `Dropdown` / `Pulldown` Menu

Is this data going to drive anything in the lifecycle of this business process?
- If there's any significance, we should use a `Reference field` so that
  we do not need a `script include` in order to grab
choice: just strings (label of first + last name)
as opposed to sys_id (unique 32 alpha-numeric string,unique identifier)

if he is going to do an approval, or a major problem, and you need a workflow for the monitor...
- in the workflow, you can use ${variables} using the sys_id, but with a `choice field`

there is value in consistency in functionality, appearance
- one of the biggest enemies of any implementation project (especially new) is
  adoption and pushback from new users
  - people don't like change as a rule
    - being told "you have to now learn ServiceNow"
- We want people to adopt early, get positive feedback back to management
  as that directly affects acorio's CSAT score
  - if people think it's hard to learn, we have NOT done a good job
    designing an intuitive and easy to use/learn platform

Example: Keep state in the same place (top of right column) for incident, problem, change
- Don't se different labels for the same thing (user, employee, etc)


**"Don't pave over the horse path" - John K.**
- this is a major opportunity to improve your process, easier and faster to fill out the form
- I know this adds to the learning curve, but we're going to help you manage that by making
  it more intuitive
  - The tool is an opportunity to redesign how you do basically everything in IT
  - To professionalize the department receiving ServiceNow

95% of the time you write seperate client scripts, versus piggy-backing on a pre-existing one
- If you want to use one a previous acorian had written, just reach out to the
  dev and ask if it's OK

`addOption()` = adds choices to a `Choice Field`

assignment:
having a conversation
why do you want to have a drop down?

in my pdi:
why don't you make this monitor a reference field
write a script include using an adv ref qualifier
filters the ref field, so they only see members of groups that beth anglin is the manager of
