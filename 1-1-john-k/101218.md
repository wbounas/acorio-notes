If you have 70 update sets to commit at once, sometimes it's better to merge them all into one

Sometimes if you move a dozen update sets, you might be moving one and run into issues where more recent updates conflict with each other
- The `merge` feature will automatically take the most recent files and use those auto-magically
  - IT JUST WORKS

On the `Update Sets` list view, the related link "Merge Update Sets" merges EVERY update set
  - NOTE: NO WARNING PROMPT!
