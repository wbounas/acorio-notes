## Text Field Focus on a Form when Navigating
By default, ServiceNow automatically focuses your text window on the 1st editable field on the form
- OOB, on INC this is the "Number" field
  - `glide.ui.focus_first_element` is the sys_property that handles this
    - if FALSE, no field gets focus
    - if TRUE, the above behavior is observed

Can use client script to scriptively choose the field to focus
  - With reference fields, need to use

# When you are scriptively trying to utilize a value from a string/choice field
parseInt(choice-value) <- Use this for choices inside of conditions
  - Every now and then, string fields




### Child Incidents
Down in this related list where you have "New" and "Edit", I only want CERTAIN PEOPLE to see a certain button
- Conditionally show those buttons
  - Right click on Column > Configure > `List Layout`
  - This is where you decide the default view of the list
  - Navigate to Column > Configure > `List Control`
    - You can choose to omit whichever button you want
      - You can control many things (omit filters, columns, etc.)
- Must give yourself the power to `Omit edit condition` and `Omit new condition`
  - This enables you to _SCRIPT_


### Default Update Set on Project
Good practice to go back into the Default Update Set for things you've updated to clean things up



### Watching a Field
Right click a field > `Watch this field`
  - This opens the `Field Watcher`
    - Usually need to make bigger
    - Can say _What to Watch_
