If you extend task
- Number (auto increments)

If it's something like this, if you think about the task fields, they aren't
really useful in this case

They will have one field, name
- You don't need to extend a table in this instance


CMDB CI is the grandparent table for the entire CMDB
- Fields like Business Server, Servers, Network Routers, Switches, extends from CMDB_CI
	- Probably the 2nd most useful extended table


If you anticipate that the client wants to see these records, amnipulate the records, more often than not you will want to create a module

if you have a table that holds specific data (end 2 eend table, service deskers don't need to see that), you can uncheck "Create Module"
- In `u_nurf_application`

If you feel like this module should be under a specific application

Once you make a table, you cannot EVER change the "Name" value

Controls Related List
- Auto Number
	- Do you want this to have an auto-number field that increments

- Create access controls
	- Keep it checked, it will create 4 ACL's (CRUD)
	- Creates a new, custom role for those 4 roles

"Allow access to this table via web services"
Do you want a user to have SOAP or REST services to this table?
- If there are very senstive records here, you might want to limit the access to the table


Scoped Apps
Everything you're building in that scope (HR for example) has its own "Name Space"
- You can create a table called "Incident", and it's going to be a SEPARATAE name that does NOT conflict with what comes out of the box with ITSM
	- You can create an ITIL role, and it doesn't conflict with IITL in the global scope
- You can create a separate application for HR and CSM

1. It's its own name space so no OOB conflicts
2. It segregates access
	- In HR this is huge, because you have sensitive data
	- You don't want the head of your service desk looking into those records
		- Service Desk Admin has global access (admin is global)
			- When doing an HR project, there's an HR Admin role that gives you god power over HR
		- Typically during GoLive, the HR-Admin role is removed from the Global Admin role so that only the proper people have visibility into HR records and data
