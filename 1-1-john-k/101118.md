# 1:1 w/ John Kanthak (October 11th, 2018)

Cannot add 'Versions' related lists to Records (incidents, problems)
- CAN add to scripts (ui policies, etc.)

Display Business Rules
- 99% of the time used to pass information to the `g_scratchpad` (for workflows)
  - Client scripts will only have access to what is visible on the form, not what's in the table
    - Old way: invisible field with values that's on the field
    - Better way: Display Biz Rule (running server side) can grab fields without invisible fields:w
