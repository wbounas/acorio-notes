# 1:1 w/ John K

Most Biz Rules are before

Reference Qualifier = Qualifies a list of records
- Only see a list of records that meet this criteria
- Modifies a list of records

DIFFERENT than Conditions
- Conditions tell you when to run specific rules or scripts


`new Workflow().broadcastEventToCurrentsContexts(grRITM, 'update', null);`
- Broadcast a ping to the Workflow!


Note: .get() requires a parameter
- ONLY RETURNS FIRST RECORD
  - Be aware if the query is too broad


HW for Next Week 10/8:
- Try to extract Parameter 3 in `broadcastEventToCurrentsContexts` as a string for "Howdy"
  - How can I get that third parameter to show up in my workflow?

Biz Rules
Be AWARE if you are in a Before or After Biz Rules
  - NEVER call .update(); in a Before Biz Rule
    - You will be in infinite loop
    - Dum dum!
