Building a New Catalog Item (Customer Version)
- Many times, when a customer is sending you a Catalog Item, it is replacing a pre-xisting thing
  - "It has worked well for us!"
    - _This is an opportunity to make it work better for you!_
  - Sometimes, the client is rigid and does NOT want to change anything
    - This is when TC meets Consultant
      - SN is a different platform, different tool
      - We will meet your business need, but can improve
      - I have some suggestions for some improvements
        - Give your fulfiller some insight that they might not have had before


## Questions to Ask Yourself
- Fields to show and Hide
- Sections to conditionally show/hide
  - Strongly recommend using a PERSONAL TEMPLATE THING
    - Color Code
    - Build it all in EXCEL before building in ServiceNow
    - Notes for what is still needed to be done
- _Nothing_ in here that anything should be a "Variable Set"
  - You can use a VS with as many SC Items as you'd like if they are re-used


Space things out, keep things modular
- Keep it _possible_ to make changes
  - Use `1000` blocks for order to give yourself max flexibility


`Client:` "One of the things we LOVE is that the forms are NICELY laid out, they are NOT really long....don't have to scroll!"
- "We do NOT want to lose that. We want to use the real estate on the screen in a most efficient way! NO SCROLLING!"
  - If there are 85 fields on the form, but when it FIRST LOADS they only see 3 (collapsed forms), they'd be happy
    - If answers create more questions, and they start to scroll, then they don't like it
    -


### Labels and Questions
Sometimes, the "Questions" or "Labels" are NOT what you might feel like they want to be
- You DON'T want to go and change (unless a mispelling, dangling participle)
  - Must be careful
  - You HAVE to run it by the client
- Do NOT take the technical stuff as gospel (doesn't really understand SN maybe)


UI Policies, Client Scripts


As a fulfiller, I would like to go and change this stuff on the TASK level
- There are SOME parts of this form that are really for the benefit of the fulfiller
  - We want them to be able to change things in the TASK
    - To UPDATE some of the things they see
    - This will UPDATE some of the things on the RITM
