You can query the `Script` field on a table using the filter!

Looking at form update history

`sys_update_xml.list` <- includes every update ever made in the Instance
- If you filter on `form layout`, it will show you all form updates by table (target name)
  - EX: If you want only form changes on the Incident table, filter `Target name =Incident`
- Can also filter on `Dictionary`, etc.

**NOTE:** This can be VERY useful to find if the client has been messing around


============================

Typically in a UI Policy, you are creating _conditions_ to do certain things with the fields
  - If you need to do something more advanced, you can `run scripts`
  - EX: Instead of conditionally running, you can "execute if true"
    - You can write a script that runs every time, and employ your logic inside of there

You cannot access the currently logged in user using the condition builder for a UI Policy for a table


g_user (client side) has a method hasRole to check if the user has the role on their record
  - has key `elements` which is an array of ALL the fields on the form
  - setReadOnly passes the name of the field

Fields on forms are objects
- They have properties
  - fieldName is the system name
  - `label` is the human readable name


**NOTE:** If you are writing a script within a UI Policy, keep it to Mandatory, Visibility, or Read-Only
- Police yourself to do UI Policy stuff within UI Policies so that future developers can maintain
