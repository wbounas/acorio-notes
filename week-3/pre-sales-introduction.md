# Pre-Sales Introduction (Meg Lockwood)

## Sales Lifecycle
Marketing, Outreach (Huge Funnel)
- As something has been appropriately qualified, then pre-sales gets involved
  - Pre-sales is not introductory calls, etc...

"A process that conveys confidence to the prospect, advises them as an experienced guide, helps sales craft a winning propsosal, and sets delivery up for success with the goal of a successful and satisfied client"
- Kind of piecing together all of the departments, and ensuring we have a happy-client

Not about *giving demos*, but rather about _telling stories and having a conversation_
