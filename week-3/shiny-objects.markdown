# Shiny Objects / Visual Taskboards (Max Dore)
- Visual Taskboards (VTB) transform the navigation of lists and forms into an interactive graphical experience
  - For ITIL-Fufillers

ServiceNow VTB's are updated in real time for `true collaboration`

Serve Many Different Purposes
- _Freeform_: provide greatest flexibliity
  - Add tasks in customizable lanes
  - Anything goes
- _Flexible Board_: best option when you don't want to impact the existing work or workflow
  - Personal to-do's
  - Planning exercises
  - Lane-changes will NOT update underlying records
- _Guided Board_: display tasks that match the configured filter against a particular table, like flexible boards
  - Members of guided boards can add task cards, which are removed automatically when the tasks no longer match the filter conditions
  - Guided board lanes correspond to field values and cannot be edited in most cases

There are a lot of options
- More user-accessible UX
